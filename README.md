## Description

Project Name: Pawtify

Tagline: Music for every party animal

Concept: You and your friends are together and want something to listen to, but you aren't sure what will fit all your musical tastes...enter Pawtify

Premise: Social media site for music recommendations based on combination of artists, songs, and genres among friends.

The difference factor: combinations of seeds for generation are taken from the users' selected friends at the time. (I'm with Cody, Eugene, and Ty so we can choose 2 seeds from each person and have it generate recommendations based on that combination)
